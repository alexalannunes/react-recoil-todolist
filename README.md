A state management library for React


:fire: What I've learned?

* **Atoms**: Atoms contain the source of truth for our application state. In our todo-list, the source of truth will be an array of objects, with each object representing a todo item.
* **Selector**: A selector represents a piece of derived state. You can think of derived state as the output of passing state to a pure function that derives a new value from the said state.
