<strong>Recoil</strong>

A state management library for React


What I've learned? :fire:

* **Atoms**: Atoms contain the source of truth for our application state. In our todo-list, the source of truth will be an array of objects, with each object representing a todo item.
* **Selector**: A selector represents a piece of derived state. You can think of derived state as the output of passing state to a pure function that derives a new value from the said state.

### Features :tada:

- [x] Add todo items
- [x] Edit todo items
- [x] Delete todo items
- [x] Filter todo items
- [x] Display useful stats
